# Compiler support for multi- and many-core embedded platform

- **Extensions to the RISC-V ISA**  
The goal is to extend a compiler (GCC/LLVM) at back-end and middle-end level to exploit the benefits of new hardware extensions.
Our target is [PULP][pulp], an open-source hardware platform to explore new and efficient architectures for ultra-low-power processing.
The adoption of open-source hardware substantially lowers costs in comparison to proprietary technologies and this approach has led to the emergence of new business models in recent years.
However the lack of compiler-level support is often a limiting factor in the adoption of such solutions, especially when custom extensions are necessary.This project is an opportunity to dive into the internals of a compilation toolchain and gain the skills to enable emergent computing systems.
