# Active Research Projects & Collaborations

EEES is a core contributor to the open-source [PULP Platform][pulp] project, aimed at developing an open, scalable hardware and software research and development platform for ultra-high-efficiency computing for applications such as artificial intelligence and data analytics on milliWatt-scale devices.

We are partners of the following collaborative projects:

- **[European Processor Initiative (EPI)][epi]**
- **[Open Transprecision Computing (OPRECOMP)][oprecomp]**
- **[Artificial Intelligence for Digitizing Industry (AI4DI)][ai4di]**

We have very strong ties with several academic labs and industries in Europe and the US, including
(but not limited to):
- Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland
- GreenWaves Technologies, Grenoble, France
- STMicroelectronics, Agrate Brianza, Italy
- University of California, Berkeley, USA

# Student Projects, Master Theses & Research Grants

We are often looking for students and/or collaborators in many pioneering research areas.
Students from the University of Bologna can participate to the laboratory's research
with curricular or extra-curricular project activities, or perform high-effort (but also high-satisfaction!)
master thesis work with us.
We also accept a limited number of excellent visiting master thesis students from other universities.
